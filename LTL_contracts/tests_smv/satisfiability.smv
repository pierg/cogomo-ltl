/--
All the formula are checked negated,
if false, it means that the formula is valid and the counterexample is a valid assignment
--/

/--
Case where Guarantees are NOT included in the Assumptions: A = !b, G = b
--/

-- Consistency:     Guarantees Saturated = b | b = !b -> b
LTLSPEC !(!b -> b);
-- The formula is valid, assignment: b = TRUE

-- Compatibility:   Assumptions = !b
LTLSPEC !(!b);
-- The formula is valid, assignment: b = FALSE

-- Satisfiability_1:     A -> G (WRONG)
LTLSPEC !(!b -> (!b -> b));
-- The formula still results valid for b = TRUE

-- Satisfiability_2:     A & (A -> G) (CORRECT)
LTLSPEC !(!b & (!b -> (!b -> b)));
-- The formula still results invalid, there is no assignment of variables to satisfy it. This is what we want
